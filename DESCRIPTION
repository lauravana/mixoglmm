Title: A shared random effects model for mixed outcomes
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Laura Vana
Maintainer: The package maintainer <laura.vana@tuwien.ac.at>
Description: A shared random effects model for normal and non-normal outcomes 
  is proposed where flexible contraints can be set on the regression coefficients 
  for each outcome. Conditional on the random effects, the additional dependence 
  among the normal outcomes can be modeled through a correlation structure.
